# Home-Assistant Matter CLI Client

While working with the Home-Assistant Matter Add-On I failed to pair a device like the Nanoleaf Essentials Bulb with the iOS Home Assistant App. With the help of the [Community Forum](https://community.home-assistant.com) I've learned about the problem of commissioning a Matter Device by using the Home Assitant App and a Skyconnect Thread Network.

## Build the App

```sh
cargo build -r
```

## Run the App

```

```
